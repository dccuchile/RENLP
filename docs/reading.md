## Reading List

The following list contains topics we intend to discuss in our seminars:

1. [Language Models as Knowledge Bases](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01066)
1. [Pointer Networks](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5866-pointer-networks.pdf)
1. [Bidirectional LSTM-CRF models for sequence tagging](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.01991)
1. [Sequence level training with recurrent neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06732): this paper introduces the idea of using reinforcement learning to optimize non-differentiable metrics such as BLEU.
1. [Neural Architecture Search with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01578.pdf)
2. [Linguistic Knowledge and Transferability of Contextual Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08855)
